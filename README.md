# osu! Mania Clone

A simple clone of the rhythm game osu! Mania.

## How To Play

Press the D, F, J, and K keys to the beat. As the notes fall from  
the top of the screen, press these keys when the notes hit the  
judgement line (horizontal gray line) at the bottom.

Long notes have a white body that looks like a column. Hit / Miss  
is counted at the beginning and end of long notes, meaning you have  
to time when to press the key and when to release the key. Releasing  
early while the body is still passing through the judgement line  
will result in a miss, but it's better than not hitting the beginning  
of the long note at all.

Pressing the Space key starts the game, and pressing the P key stops  
and resets the game.
